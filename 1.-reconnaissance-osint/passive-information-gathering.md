# Passive information gathering

Passive information gathering typically occurs at the beginning of an engagement. The goal of this phase is to increase understanding of the target infrastructure, business practices, and  information available via open source. The information gathered during this step are used to inform later stages of the engagement.

#### Browse target's public facing web site(s) and social media

* What does the target do?  Do they have a sales department? Are they hiring?
* How is the company structured?&#x20;
* Look for information about their operating locations. Do they have badge readers, break areas, security, fencing?
* Look for contact information for key personnel (leadership/management, IT personnel, etc.)
* Collect phone and fax numbers, email addresses, position titles, pictures, etc. Identify email address structure.
* Pay particular attention to "about" pages, as these often contain names, social media links, and email addresses.
* Can you identify any internal business practices using this information?&#x20;
