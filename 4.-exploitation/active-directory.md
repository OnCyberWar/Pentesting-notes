# Active Directory

When testing active directory our goals should be to:

* gain a foothold on a machine on the domain and elevate our privileges
* enumerate the domain to find additional accounts, users, etc. that ideally increase our privilege level on the domain
* gain access to the domain controller
* persist on the domain (situation dependent)

Assuming that we've already [enumerated](../3.-enumeration/active-directory.md) the domain, we should now be focused on using gathered credentials to move laterally within the domain.

### Lateral movement
