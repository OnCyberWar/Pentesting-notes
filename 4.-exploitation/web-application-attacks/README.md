# Web application attacks

Web applications often contain vulnerabilities due to a large attack surface reliant on multiple technologies, dependencies and configuration challenges. &#x20;

### Enumeration

Before attacking, attempt to discover the technologies in use

* Programming languages and frameworks
* Web server software
* Database software
* Server OS

To accomplish this task, we can use the following techniques to gather information

* Inspect URLs for extensions (php, jsp, do, html, etc.)
* Inspect page content using browser tools
* View response headers for additional information (using a proxy tool)
* Inspect site maps, robots.txt, etc.
* Attempt to locate administration consoles

### Common tools

* Dirb: web content scanner that uses wordlists to attempt to locate directories and pages
* Burp Suite: advanced proxy/web application assessment tool
* FoxyProxy: FireFox plugin that simplifies activating/deactivating Burp Suite
* Nikto: configurable web server scanner that tests for common vulnerabilities

### Admin Consoles

* First attempt to login using default username/password combinations
* Brute forcing the login may also be an option, but can be noisy and/or result in lockouts
* Burp Suite's intruder tool can be used to automate scoped brute force attempts
