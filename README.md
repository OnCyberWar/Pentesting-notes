# Welcome

Hello and welcome. This page started as a simple collection of notes developed while working towards the OSCP.  I continue to add to the collection and make updates as I continue to learn and progress in ethical hacking.

The site and resources are organized by the phases of an ethical hacking engagement. Some of these resources are more thoroughly developed, but the entire site will likely always be a work in progress.
