# 111 - NFS

### Network File System

NFS is a distributed file system protocol for sharing over a network. Often used with UNIX operating systems and is predominantly insecure in its implementation. Portmapper and RPCbind both listen on port 111 and redirects clients to appropriate ports, often TCP 2049.&#x20;

#### Scan with nmap or use NSE scripts to locate NFS shares&#x20;

```
nmap -v -p 111 10.11.1.1-254
nmap -sV -p 111 --script=rpcinfo 10.11.1.1-254 
```

#### Enumeration

```
nmap -p 111 --script nfs* $RHOST
nmap -sV -p 111 --script=rpcinfo $RHOST 
nmap -p 111 --script nfs* 10.11.1.72
rpcinfo -p $targetip
rpcbind $targetip
```

#### Mounting shares

```
showmount --exports $target_ip
mount -o nolock $target_ip:/ /mnt
```

If files aren't readable, you may be able to create a new user, then use sed to change the UUID of the user to match the requirements (su username)
